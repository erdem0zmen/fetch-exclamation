// Unity Learn Program's second Challenge Project was again a 'Fix-the-Bugs' type of challenge and I was asked to make it playable.
I have used my array and random number generation skills to program this challenge where balls are randomly falling from the sky and I had to send your dog out to catch them before they hit the ground. To complete this challenge, I had to make sure your variables are assigned properly, my if-statements are programmed correctly, my collisions are being detected perfectly, and that objects are being generated randomly.
